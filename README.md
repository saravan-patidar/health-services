# Healthcare Services Management App

[Live Demo](https://saravan-patidar.github.io/health-services/)

- Delete services
- Data persistence using `localStorage` (data will remain even after page reload)

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- CSS for basic styling using TailwindCss (or integrate any UI framework like Bootstrap)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
